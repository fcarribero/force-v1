# force-v1

I made it in highschool at the end of the year, the same year I learnt to programm in Turbo C++.

It's based on the Alien Force game for Windwos, but way better. 10 leves, each with it's unique design. They are also more intelligent, because they evade your shots.

All the graphics are made with vectors (textures? Nah), even the presentation which was made with a separate tool I made simultaneosly.

I will make Force V2 in the future. With better graphics and microtransactions (Why not?).

Note: Really really bad programming quality, you're adviced.
